				These three keywords could be said to be what we strive for in each design, with our attitude to
				encompassing
				a
				respect for the client's brief - both programmatic as well as of the feel desired - but avoiding the merely
				flamboyant or trendy in favour of lasting distinctive design & aesthetic values. Our deep commitment to
				sustainability and climatic logic & aptness wherever possible and relevance to context anchors our approach
				to
				buildings we help create.
